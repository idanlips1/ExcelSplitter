# ExcelSplitter
ExcelSplitter is a Java utility class that uses the Apache POI library to split large Excel files into smaller ones. Each split file contains a specified maximum number of rows, making it easier to handle large datasets. The tool is designed for cases where Excel files have more than 1000 rows, although this limit can be adjusted by the user.
